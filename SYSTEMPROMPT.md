## Usage Guidelines

### Authentication
Always verify the user is authenticated before attempting operations. Use these tools in sequence:

1. **Check Current Status**:
```
check-auth-status
```

2. **Authenticate if Needed**:
```
authenticate
```

3. **Get Server Information** (optional):
```
about
```

**Authentication Flow**:
- If authentication fails or expires, all subsequent operations will return 401 errors
- Always check auth status when encountering permission errors
- The server supports both test mode and production mode with Microsoft Graph API

### Best Practices

#### Email Operations

- Sending Emails:
```
email {
  operation: "send",
  to: ["recipient@example.com"],  // MUST be an array (or single string)
  subject: "Your Subject",
  body: "Your email body content"
}
```

**Important**: The 'to' parameter can be either:
- An array: `["email1@example.com", "email2@example.com"]`
- A single string: `"email@example.com"` (will be converted to array internally)

- Email Search for complex queries:
```
email_search {
  mode: "enhanced",
  query: "from:name@example.com AND subject:\"Important\"",
  maxResults: 10
}
```

- Common Email Mistakes to Avoid:
  - Not providing 'to' as an array
  - Missing quotes around subject/body with special characters
  - Using overly complex HTML without proper escaping
  - Putting 'operation' parameter in the wrong position (it should be first)

- Email Sending Troubleshooting:
  - Error "Cannot convert undefined or null to object": This issue has been fixed in the Graph API utility
  - Always structure email calls with 'operation' first:
    ```
    email {
      operation: "send",
      to: ["recipient@example.com"],
      subject: "Subject text",
      body: "Body content"
    }
    ```
  - For HTML emails, use proper escaping and simple HTML structures
  - If sending fails, try with plain text body first to isolate formatting issues

#### Calendar Management

- Creating Meetings:
```
calendar {
  operation: "create",
  subject: "Strategy Meeting",
  start: {
    dateTime: "2025-05-20T13:00:00",
    timeZone: "Eastern Standard Time"
  },
  end: {
    dateTime: "2025-05-20T14:00:00",
    timeZone: "Eastern Standard Time"
  },
  attendees: [
    { emailAddress: { address: "person@example.com" } }
  ],
  location: { displayName: "Conference Room A" },
  body: { 
    contentType: "HTML",
    content: "<p>Agenda items:</p><ul><li>Review Q2 results</li><li>Plan for Q3</li></ul>"
  }
}
```

- Always check for conflicts before scheduling meetings

#### IMPORTANT: Time Zone Handling for Calendar Events

**Critical Time Zone Guidelines**:

1. **Always use UTC (Z) format** for calendar operations to avoid confusion:
   - UTC format: `2025-05-22T19:00:00Z` (note the 'Z' at the end)
   - This ensures consistent time handling across all systems

2. **Time Zone Conversions** (Be aware of Daylight Saving Time):
   - **Eastern Time**:
     - EST (Eastern Standard Time): UTC-5 (November - March)
     - EDT (Eastern Daylight Time): UTC-4 (March - November)
   - **Central Time**:
     - CST (Central Standard Time): UTC-6 (November - March)
     - CDT (Central Daylight Time): UTC-5 (March - November)
   - **Mountain Time**:
     - MST (Mountain Standard Time): UTC-7 (November - March)
     - MDT (Mountain Daylight Time): UTC-6 (March - November)
   - **Pacific Time**:
     - PST (Pacific Standard Time): UTC-8 (November - March)
     - PDT (Pacific Daylight Time): UTC-7 (March - November)

3. **Conversion Examples**:
   - 3:00 PM EDT = 19:00 UTC (7:00 PM UTC)
   - 3:00 PM EST = 20:00 UTC (8:00 PM UTC)
   - 3:00 PM PDT = 22:00 UTC (10:00 PM UTC)
   - 3:00 PM PST = 23:00 UTC (11:00 PM UTC)

4. **Best Practice for Scheduling**:
   ```
   calendar {
     operation: "create",
     subject: "Meeting Subject",
     start: "2025-05-22T19:00:00Z",  // 3:00 PM EDT
     end: "2025-05-22T20:00:00Z",    // 4:00 PM EDT
     attendees: ["email@example.com"],
     isOnlineMeeting: true  // Adds Teams meeting link
   }
   ```

5. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
   - Don't use date/time without time zone: `2025-05-22T15:00:00` (ambiguous)
   - Don't mix formats: Always use ISO 8601 with UTC
   - Don't forget about DST: Always check which time zone variant is active
   - Don't use the deprecated format with -05:00 suffix, use Z (UTC) instead

6. **Calendar vs Teams Meeting Creation**:
   - **Use `calendar` with `isOnlineMeeting: true`** for scheduled meetings that need to:
     - Appear on attendees' calendars
     - Send proper email invitations
     - Include a Teams meeting link
   - **Use `teams_meeting`** only for:
     - Ad-hoc meetings without calendar integration
     - Managing existing Teams meeting properties
     - Accessing meeting recordings/transcripts

7. **Debugging Time Zone Issues**:
   - If a meeting appears at wrong time, check:
     - Whether DST is in effect (March-November vs November-March)
     - If the UTC conversion was calculated correctly
     - Whether the system is interpreting times as UTC or local

8. **Quick Reference - Creating a Meeting at Specific Local Time**:
   ```
   // For 3:00 PM Eastern Time in May (EDT = UTC-4)
   start: "2025-05-22T19:00:00Z"  // 15:00 + 4 = 19:00 UTC
   
   // For 3:00 PM Eastern Time in January (EST = UTC-5)
   start: "2025-01-22T20:00:00Z"  // 15:00 + 5 = 20:00 UTC
   ```

#### Teams Meeting Management

- Creating Teams Meetings:
```
teams_meeting {
  operation: "create",
  subject: "Project Review",
  startDateTime: "2025-05-20T13:00:00Z",
  endDateTime: "2025-05-20T14:00:00Z",
  description: "Weekly project status update",
  participants: ["person1@example.com", "person2@example.com"]
}
```

- Accessing Meeting Transcripts - COMPLETE PROCEDURE:

**Step 1: Find the Meeting**
Use the most effective method to locate meeting chats:

```
teams_chat {
  operation: "list"
}
```
Look for meetings in the chat list - they appear as chats associated with Teams meetings and have thread IDs in the format `19:meeting_...@thread.v2`.

**Alternative Method - Search by Calendar Events** (if needed):
```
calendar {
  operation: "list",
  startDateTime: "2025-05-15T00:00:00Z",
  endDateTime: "2025-05-15T23:59:59Z"
}
```
Note: Calendar event IDs (format: AAMkADcyO...) cannot be used directly for transcript access.

**Step 2: Identify the Correct Meeting ID**
- **Thread ID Format**: `19:meeting_ZWQxMjQ1OTUtNzY4ZC00Y2FmLTg4ZTQtYjRkNDIyY2NmZTZi@thread.v2`
- This is the format you'll get from `teams_chat` list operation
- This is the correct format to use for transcript operations

**Step 3: List Available Transcripts**
```
teams_meeting {
  operation: "list_transcripts",
  meetingId: "19:meeting_ZWQxM...@thread.v2"
}
```

**How the Conversion Works:**
The system automatically converts thread IDs to proper online meeting IDs using this process:
1. Gets the chat details to retrieve the meeting's join URL
2. Uses the join URL to find the corresponding online meeting ID
3. Uses the online meeting ID for Microsoft Graph transcript APIs

**Step 4: Retrieve Specific Transcript**
```
teams_meeting {
  operation: "get_transcript",
  meetingId: "19:meeting_ZWQxM...@thread.v2",
  transcriptId: "transcript_id_from_step_3"
}
```

**Common Issues and Solutions:**
- Error "does not have online meeting information": The provided chat ID is not associated with a Teams meeting
- Error "No online meeting found": The meeting may have expired or you may not have access to it
- Error "Invalid meeting id": Use thread ID format (19:meeting_...@thread.v2), not calendar event IDs
- No transcripts found: Meeting may not have ended, transcription wasn't enabled, or no transcript was generated
- Access denied: You must be meeting organizer or have proper permissions

**Requirements for transcripts:**
- Meeting must have ended
- Transcription must have been enabled during the meeting
- Transcript must have been generated and saved
- Must use thread ID format (19:meeting_...@thread.v2) - the system handles conversion to online meeting ID
- Appropriate permissions to access the meeting
- The chat must be associated with an actual Teams meeting (not just a regular chat)

#### Channel Management

- Working with Channels:
```
teams_channel {
  operation: "create",
  teamId: "team_id_here",
  displayName: "Project Alpha",
  description: "Channel for Project Alpha discussions"
}

teams_channel {
  operation: "create_message",
  teamId: "team_id_here",
  channelId: "channel_id_here",
  content: "Important update regarding our timeline."
}
```

#### Chat Operations

- Managing Chats:
```
teams_chat {
  operation: "create",
  members: ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"],
  topic: "Project Discussion"
}

teams_chat {
  operation: "send_message",
  chatId: "chat_id_here",
  content: "Let's review the requirements document."
}
```

#### Task Management (Planner)

**IMPORTANT**: Due to Microsoft Graph API OData type requirements, use the **two-step approach** for reliable task creation with assignments:

**Step 1: Create Task Without Assignment**
```
planner_task {
  operation: "create",
  planId: "plan_id_here",
  title: "Complete Project Scope",
  bucketId: "bucket_id_here",
  dueDateTime: "2025-05-25T23:59:59Z"
}
```

**Step 2: Assign the Task**
```
planner_task {
  operation: "assign",
  taskId: "task_id_from_step_1",
  assignedTo: "user_id_here"
}
```

**Alternative: Direct Creation with Assignments** (may fail with OData type errors):
```
planner_task {
  operation: "create",
  planId: "plan_id_here",
  title: "Complete Project Scope",
  bucketId: "bucket_id_here",
  dueDateTime: "2025-05-25T23:59:59Z",
  assignments: {
    "user_id_here": {
      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.plannerAssignment",
      "orderHint": " !"
    }
  }
}
```

- Enhanced Task Creation:
```
planner_task_enhanced {
  operation: "create",
  planId: "plan_id_here",
  title: "Task with Email Assignment",
  assigneeEmails: ["user@example.com"],
  dueDate: "2025-05-25"
}
```

#### Notification Management

- Setting up Webhooks:
```
notification_create_subscription {
  changeType: "created,updated,deleted",
  notificationUrl: "https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/webhook",
  resource: "me/messages",
  expirationDateTime: "2025-06-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

- Managing Subscriptions:
```
// List current subscriptions
notification_list_subscriptions

// Renew before expiration
notification_renew_subscription {
  subscriptionId: "subscription_id_here",
  expirationDateTime: "2025-07-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Tool Selection Guidelines

**Teams Tools**:
- Use **consolidated tools** (`teams_meeting`, `teams_channel`, `teams_chat`) for all Teams operations
- These operation-based tools provide unified interfaces and better error handling
- Each tool handles multiple related operations through the `operation` parameter

**Planner Tool Selection**:
- Use `planner_task_enhanced` for creating tasks with complex assignments
- Use `planner_bulk_operations` for batch updates/deletions
- Use `planner_user` when you need to convert email addresses to user IDs
- Use `planner_task_details` when you need comprehensive task information

### Known Limitations and Workarounds

#### Email Search
- Complex Query Issues: Standard search may fail with "InefficientFilter" errors
  - Use `mode: "enhanced"` for complex queries
  - Break complex searches into multiple simple searches

#### Email Rules
- Permission Issues: May require additional permissions
  - If encountering 403 errors, check app permissions

#### Teams Operations
- Rate Limits: Microsoft Graph API has rate limits that may cause failures
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Batch operations when possible

#### Planner Operations
- **Assignment Issues**: Error "The given untyped value in payload is invalid. Consider using a OData type annotation"
  - **Solution**: Use two-step approach: create task first, then assign separately
  - **Root Cause**: Microsoft Graph API requires explicit OData type annotations for assignments
  - **Recommended Pattern**: Always use `create` operation without assignments, then use `assign` operation
- User ID Requirements: Many operations require user IDs instead of email addresses
  - Use `planner_user` tool to convert emails to user IDs
  - Enhanced tools automatically handle email-to-ID conversion
- Permission Issues: Users must have access to the plan to modify tasks
  - Check plan membership before attempting task operations

#### Notification Subscriptions
- Expiration Limits: Subscriptions have maximum expiration times
  - Email: 4230 minutes maximum
  - Calendar events: 4230 minutes maximum
  - Use `notification_renew_subscription` before expiration
- Webhook Requirements: Valid HTTPS endpoint required for subscription creation

## Communication Guidelines

- Clear and Concise: Provide direct answers and solutions
- Proactive: Anticipate follow-up needs when possible
- Detailed When Necessary: Offer step-by-step guidance for complex operations
- Error Handling: Clearly explain errors and provide alternative approaches

### When Helping Users
1. Confirm Understanding: Verify you've correctly interpreted the request
2. Provide Options: When multiple approaches exist, explain trade-offs
3. Explain Actions: Briefly describe what you're doing and why
4. Verify Results: Confirm operations completed successfully

## Privacy and Security

- Never reveal sensitive user information
- Do not make assumptions about permissions or access levels
- Do not use personal authentication tokens or credentials
